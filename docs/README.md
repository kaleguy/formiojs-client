Examples of using the formio.js form renderer as a standalone client library.

[Formio](http://wwww.form.io) is an innovative platform for building web apps, consisting of

* **a form builder GUI**
* **a form renderer** (for displaying forms built with the form builder)
* **an application server** integrated with the form builder and form renderer

The form.io server has features, including permissioning and user management making it easy to
build enterprise-level apps with minimal coding.

The basic server and form builder are open source and work with all frameworks.

In fact, the open source form renderer can work with any framework and any backend, even without
the form.io server. Create a complex form on the form.io site, then export the form JSON and use
the form renderer to build the form on your site.

This repo has a couple of examples of forms created from form.io JSON and displayed with the formio.js
form renderer.
